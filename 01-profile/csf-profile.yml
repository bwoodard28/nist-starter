# Pick 3–5 outcomes you will actually implement first.
prioritized_outcomes:
  - id: "PR.AA-05"
    title: "Least privilege & SoD enforced and reviewed"
    rationale: "Reduce blast radius and credential abuse"
    target_state: "Quarterly access reviews, RBAC/ABAC enforced, break-glass with approvals"
    success_metrics:
      - "100% prod admin accounts enrolled in MFA"
      - "Quarterly access reviews completed with evidence"
      - "Privileged roles reduced by ≥ 30%"
  - id: "DE.CM-01"
    title: "Network/services monitored to find adverse events"
    rationale: "Early detection reduces dwell time"
    target_state: "Centralized logging + detections for auth, network, admin, and data-access events"
    success_metrics:
      - "Critical detections with on-call routing"
      - "Mean time to triage (MTTT) < 30 minutes"
      - "Coverage: ≥ 90% critical assets sending logs"
  - id: "RS.MA-01"
    title: "IR plan executed with internal & third parties"
    rationale: "Coordinated response prevents chaos"
    target_state: "Documented IRP, roles, playbooks, vendor comms; one tabletop completed"
    success_metrics:
      - "IRP approved and published"
      - "1 tabletop exercise with findings → tracked to closure"
      - "IR comms templates available and tested"
  - id: "PR.DS-11"
    title: "Backups created, protected, tested"
    rationale: "Recovery requires tested/immutable backups"
    target_state: "3-2-1 backups, immutability, monthly restore tests"
    success_metrics:
      - "Monthly restore test success rate: 100%"
      - "RPO ≤ 24h, RTO ≤ 8h for core DB"
  - id: "GV.OC-03"
    title: "Legal/regulatory/contractual requirements managed"
    rationale: "Compliance readiness and customer trust"
    target_state: "Obligations inventory, mapped to controls; review cadence established"
    success_metrics:
      - "Obligations register maintained quarterly"
      - "Gaps tracked with owners & due dates"
